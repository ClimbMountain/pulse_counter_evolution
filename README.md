# Pulse Counting Gene Circuit Evolution

This repository contains code and documentation for the computational evolution of a synthetic gene circuit that exhibits pulse-counting behavior. The project leverages Python-based optimization techniques—including evolutionary algorithms and gradient-based methods—to design and analyze gene network architectures with the capacity to "count" discrete stimulation events.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop a minimal yet robust gene circuit that can reliably count input pulses. This circuit is expected to integrate features of oscillation, memory, and decision-making, enabling potential applications in biosensing, therapeutic delivery, and developmental biology.

### Key Components:
- **Simulation Framework:** A Python-based environment for modeling gene circuits using systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
- **Fitness Function:** Metrics to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the pulse-counting behavior.
- **Optimization Algorithms:** Implementation of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and gradient descent (or hybrid methods) to search for optimal circuit topologies and parameter configurations.
- **Analysis Tools:** Scripts for dynamic behavior analysis including time-series plots, phase portraits, and robustness testing.
